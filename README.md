# Task: White Blood Cell Classification

The objective of this task is to train a machine learning model to classify different types of white blood cells (WBCs). The specific types of WBCs to be classified are as follows: bands, basophils, blasts, eosinophils, lymphocytes, metamyelocytes, monocytes, myelocytes, and neutrophils. Data is given in the attachment. Once the model is trained, write a program to utilize the trained model for classifying images stored in the "classify-images" folder into the aforementioned classes.

## Instructions

To run this project on Google Colab, follow these steps:

Download the "task.zip" file, which contains all the necessary datasets for the project.

Upload the "task.zip" file to your Google Drive.

Connect your Google Colab file to your Google Drive using the code given already in the colab file.

After connecting, you can access the "task.zip" file from your Google Drive within the Colab environment.

Once the project is set up and you have run the necessary code to build the model.

I have created 3 model(Random forest,support vector machine and Xgboost).

I have also predicted classify test images from every model and printed after the model is built.

built model pickle file is also saved in the model folder to access if you dont want to run the code but still want the prediction(remember before sendimg image to the specific model conver the image into there pixel values).
